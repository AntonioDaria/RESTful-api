## Bookstore RESTful API and front end interface client side ##
-RESTful API built From Scratch with no framework or generators Using Node, Express and MongoDB

-In addition to the server API I have also built on the client side a front end interface with complete CRUD
 functionalities

## Usage ##
-Clone or download and run **npm install**
-Run **node app** to start

## How to interact without front end interface ##
You can interact with the API without using the front end interface and use get, post, put and delete
requests by using Resteasy a chrome tool that is targeted against developers who perform RESTful API calls against third party services.
